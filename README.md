# Beer-O-Clock Project

## Start of Project

Looking forward to building this project with ReactJS. While I am still very new to the world of React, this is a much needed challenge. I am more than likely going to struggle and need to look to our trusty friend 'Google' to get me through it, but it should be fun nonetheless.

Goal: To commit and push more changes to github throughout the process of this project.
